## Introduction

Clerk is a developer-first authentication and user management solution. It provides pre-built React components and hooks for sign-in, sign-up, user profile, and organization management. Clerk is designed to be easy to use and customize, and can be dropped into any React or Next.js application.

This repository demonstrates how to use Clerk to create a tRPC context that uses Clerk's authentication context, so that you can use Clerk's authentication state in your tRPC procedures. For more information, see the [guide in the Clerk Docs](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/trpc).

## Deploy
